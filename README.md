# hello-world
Hello everyone.

My name is Fatima Barragan. 
I am currently a master's student at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy pursuing a degree in Public Policy and Data Analytics. 
This program allows me to focus on the intersection of policy, technology, and data. 
My career path involves leveraging data and technology in policy solutions to support underrepresented communities. 
I am actively seeking a Summer 2022 internship opportunity with companies that support my interests and advocates for our communities. Thank you! :)
